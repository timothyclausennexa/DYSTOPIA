# Check if port is in use
lsof -i :3000

# Restart all processes
pm2 restart all
```

echo $SUPABASE_URL
echo $SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY

# Test connection
cd server
tsx src/api/db/verify-tables.ts
```

### High Memory Usage

pm2 restart dystopia-game-server

# Scale down instances
pm2 scale dystopia-game-server 2
```

### WebSocket Not Working
